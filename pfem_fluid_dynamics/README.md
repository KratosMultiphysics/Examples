# PFEMFluidDynamics Examples

## Applications used

You can run 2D examples using the GiD interface of PfemFluidDynamicsApplication.

Select the problem data "kratos", then pick on "Pfem" button, finally the "Pfem Fluid" logo.

Then you have to choose the dimension of the problem. Both 2D and 3D analysis can be done.

However, the examples are created just for the 2D case. So please pick on the 2D icon that will appear.

Once the PfemFluid interface is open, you will see at the left column the icons of two examples, one for fluid dynamics and the other for fluid-structure interaction (FSI).

Once you have selected one of the two cases, you just have to save the file, create the mesh and run the calculation.
