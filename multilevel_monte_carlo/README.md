# Multilevel Monte Carlo Application Examples

## Use Cases
- [Compressible potential flow problem](use_cases/compressible_potential_flow/README.md)
- [Fluid dynamics building problem](use_cases/fluid_dynamics_building)

## Validation Cases
- [Elliptic benchmark](validation/elliptic_benchmark)

## Remarks
- In case running with `PyCOMPSs` gives errors, try to replace relative paths with absolute paths, as first attempt to fix the issue.
