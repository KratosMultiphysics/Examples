## Remarks
- To run with `PyCOMPSs`, it is necessary to compile it first. You can find a detailed guide on how to do it in the [Kratos wiki](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/How-to-run-multiple-cases-using-PyCOMPSs). In addition, the environment variable `EXAQUTE_BACKEND=pycompss` must be set. We refer to the [MultilevelMonteCarloApplication documentation](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/tree/master/applications/MultilevelMonteCarloApplication#pycompss) for further details.
In case running with `PyCOMPSs` gives errors, try to replace relative paths with absolute paths in configuration `json` files, as first attempt to fix the issue.
- These examples make use of some external libraries that are not compatible with the Kratos binaries. In order to try these examples, it is necessary to compile Kratos on your own machine.
