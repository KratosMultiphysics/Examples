## Case Specification
This is a 2D simulation of the classical Sod shock tube benchmark, using the Euler equations. This test case was popularized by Gary A. Sod (1).

The problem geometry consists in a rectangular domain, 1 meter long and 0.1 meters wide, with free-slip conditions on log sides and open boundaries on the sort sides. The Sod shock problem is one-dimensional, which coincides with the X-axis in this case. Hence, no variations along the Y-axis are obseeerved.

The initial condition is diferent on the left and right sides. The separation is located at x=0.5.

| Property      | Left side     | Right side    |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Density       | 1.0           | 0.125         |
| Pressure      | 1.0           | 0.1           |
| Velocity      | 0.0           | 0.0           |

Concerning the material, a perfect fluid with the characteristic parameters listed below is used.
* Dynamic viscosity (&mu;): 0
* Thermal conductivity (&kappa;): 0
* Specific heat (_c<sub>p</sub>_): 722.14 _J/KgK_
* Heat capacity ratio (&gamma;): 1.4

An adaptive time step strategy based on the CFL is used.

## Results
The problem is solved with a Variational Multi-Scale stabilized compressible Navier-Stokes formulation written in conservative variables (2). An explicit third order otal-variational-diminishing Runge-Kutta explicit strategy is used for the time discretization, see (3) for more details. The physics-based shock capturing technique described in (4) is also used.

The computational domain is meshed with 36k linear triangular elements. Below are three snapshots depicting the density, velocity and x-velocity profiles at t=0.15. This case's is interest is in the featuring of three compressible phenomena, from left to right: a rarefication, a contact discontinuity and a normal shock.
