# Use Case IGA – Single-Patch Shell with Weak Supports and Line Load

Short description

This example demonstrates a single-patch IGA shell in membrane action, where Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed weakly using a penalty approach.
A distributed line load is applied along a curve of the NURBS surface.
The setup serves as a minimal tutorial example for weak boundary condition enforcement and curve-based loading in IGA shells.
